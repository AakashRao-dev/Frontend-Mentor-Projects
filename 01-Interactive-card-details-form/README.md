# Frontend Mentor - Interactive card details form solution

## A simple Overview

Challenge was moderate with the Vanilla CSS and JavaScript. I actually implemented the card number formatting and limits using a JavaScript library called Cleave.js

### The challenge

At first it seems to be easy but it took a while to break the logic of validation of the data that is being collected from the form.
